# efp-solutions-js


Welcome to my little corner of chaos + growth.
I’m working through the book Exercises for Programmers and solving every challenge in JavaScript as part of my dev comeback era.

This repo is where I dump my solutions, track my progress, and basically document the fact that I’m not playing about this tech life anymore.

### Why I’m doing this

– To sharpen my JavaScript skills.

– To build a portfolio that actually shows my coding brain.

– To stay consistent with my #BackAtItWithJavaScript journey.

– To prove to myself that discipline >>> vibes (sometimes 😭)

### 📁 Structure

Each problem gets its own folder like this:
```
    /
    ├── 01-hello-world/
    │   └── solution.js
    ├── 02-counting-characters/
    │   └── solution.js
    ├── 03-…
    │   └── solution.js
    └── README.md
```


(I’ll update this as I go. Accountability but make it aesthetic.)

### Tech Stack

JavaScript (my day-one fr)

Node.js for running the practice files.
